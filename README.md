# Machine_Learning_Data_Science

Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine Learning is applied using Algorithms to process the data and get trained for delivering future predictions without human intervention. The inputs for Machine Learning are the set of instructions or data or observations. Machine Learning is used extensively by companies like Facebook, Google, etc.
